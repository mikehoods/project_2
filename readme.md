# VICTORY virtual plant swap

## Installation

No installation necessary. 

## Live Site

## Usage

Easy online swapping of plants, seeds, crops, or other garden items. Anyone can log on and view available items by type, but login is required for actual swapping. 

## Technologies Used

HTML, Javascript, CSS, mongoDB, based web app, deployed on heroku.

## Future Versions

Victory is currently a one person operation. There are many improvements I would like to implement as soon as my time and ability permits. Some future features include searching by location, improved messaging, member profiles, and the ability to upload images instead of just link them from an outside site.
